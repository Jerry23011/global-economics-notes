# Our Fragile Planet
“Earth in Space”

### General Information
#### How to observe
- The U.S. Space program (NASA) has space telescope **Hubble** has taken many amazing images of distant galaxies and other astronomical structures during the past 31 years.
#### The model of Space
- A simplified model for the scale of “Cosmological” organization would be like an **upside down triangle**
	- Universe (top)
	- Galaxy (middle)
	- Solar System (bottom)
#### Origins – The “Big Bang”
- The Hubble telescope has also detected light from the earliest Universe, only now estimated to be 13.5 Billion years old – when the “**Big Bang**” formed it.
- We can say this since we know that light travels at 186, 000 miles (or 296 700 km) per second. At that speed, light from these points of light have taken 13.5 billion years to reach us at the speed of light.
#### Measuring distance units – Deep space to “near” space
- Measuring distance in space in terms of the speed of light is the most practical,
- Whereas, the distance to our next star is **4.2 light years**, (compare that with 13.5 Billion), our own Moon is just **two** “**light seconds**” from Earth (i.e., the time it takes to send an electronic signal).
- By contrast, it took **4.5** “**light hours**” for computer commands to reach, and electronic images to return from a recent probe to Pluto.
#### Galaxies –on edge, from above, and below.
- Earth and its solar system lie in a galaxy of stars we call “***The Milky Way***”.
- Our galaxy has a distinct spiral shape – in plan view, while other galaxies resemble “**discs**”, but each of them consists of millions (often hundreds of millions) of stars.
- Earth’s solar system lies on a spiral “arm” of stars about **2/3 of the way from our galaxy’s center.**
#### Planetary Nebula Gas clouds like the “Pillars of Eternity”
- Looking up the southwest summer night sky near the constellation Sagittarius on a summer’s night, we face the center of our Milky Way galaxy.
- Recent observations suggest that a dense “**black hole**” is found there.
- “**Black holes**” are in the fabric of space – swallowing light itself
#### Our Solar System – The Planets  
OVERVIEW
- Astronomers now agree that there are **eight (8)** planets in our solar system orbiting our star – the Sun.
- Pluto, considered a major planet for over 70 years, is now classified as a “dwarf planet” part of the outer “**Kuiper Belt**” objects.
#### Measuring distance within our Solar System
- The distance from Earth to the Sun, our star, is over 93 million miles (150 M. km),
- Astronomers conveniently describe this distance as **1 “Astronomical Unit” – 1 AU**.
- To compare, the dwarf planet Pluto just visited by a probe, is **39.48** A.U.’s, or multiples of Earth’s distance from the Sun.
#### Scale (or sizes) of the Planets
- It is generally accepted now that the Solar System consists of four (4) small terrestrial, or rocky Planets including Earth orbiting the Sun in the “inner” Solar System, and four (4) larger “Gas giants” in the “outer” solar system.
#### Inner Solar System – Small Rocky (Terrestrial Planets)
- Planets are closer together in the inner solar system than in the outer solar system.
- The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
- They are called the “Terrestrial” planets because they all have rock y crusts and dense mantles & core.
- In many ways, they are like our own planet Earth.
- The term Terrestrial comes from the word *Terra*, the Latin word for Earth.

### Planetary Tour
#### Mercury
- Smallest “terrestrial” or rocky planet
- Orbits closest to the Sun at a distance of 58 million km (ATLAS)
- Very high Surface temperature (hundreds of degrees Celsius)
   1/6th Earth’s density
- No moon or atmosphere
#### Venus
- Terrestrial (rocky) Planet with a diameter of 12 100 km, considered “Earth’s twin”
- Between Mercury and Earth 108 million km from the Sun
- Very hot, dense atmosphere of carbon monoxide and sulfuric acid 
- Rotates very, very slowly so one side becomes hot while the other is dark and cold
- Few craters, as meteors burn up in dense atmosphere
- No moon
#### Earth
- “Third Rock from the Sun”
- Diameter = 12 756 km
- Rotates every 23 hours and 56 minutes
- Orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days
- Has an atmosphere consisting largely of Oxygen/Nitrogen, plus a magnetosphere to protect it from radiation 
- Has one Moon which plays an important role
#### Mars
- The “red” Planet, featuring oxidized iron
- About 1/3 of Earth’s diameter and 1/6 gravity
- Orbits the Sun every 2.6 “Earth” years at a distance of 228 Million km
- A thin atmosphere, with little gravity – and a possible Earth-like past
- Long considered the best possibility for life elsewhere in solar system
###### The Asteroid Belt
- A zone of broken space rocks between the Inner Terrestrial planets and the Outer “Gas Giant” Planets
- Perhaps a former planet shattered by gravitational forces
- Largest of these are odd-shaped **Vesta** (top), and **Ceres** (below), with its mysterious shiny ice “eye”.
#### The *Gas* Giants
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all named after Roman Gods are called “gas giants” because these planets’ are huge, that their atmospheres are made of methane, and hydrogen – and may lack rocky cores.
- Some consider one (Jupiter) to be a “failed star” BUT, in fact, it only reflects the sun’s light
#### Jupiter – King of the Planets
- Largest planet of the Solar system = 30 X Earth’s diameter orbiting at 6 AU from the sun
- Hydrogen-based atmosphere and great size creates great gravity – an 80 kg human weighs 800 kg on Jupiter!
- Famous for “red spot”, which is actually a storm
- Has 62 known satellites, or moons circling it
##### Best chances for life in the outer Solar System
- Jupiter's Europa
- Saturn's Enceledus
#### Saturn – the ringed planet
- Second-largest gas giant planet in Solar system with 2/3 Jupiter’s mass
- Famous for its distinct “rings” – light reflecting off dust and rocks circling the planet in a thin plane
- Orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.4 Billion km, – 9 AU (ATLAS)
- Has 67 ? Known moons.
- Titan – Saturn’s moon of hydrocarbon (oil) seas
#### Uranus
- First of two outer gas giant planets, it orbits 2.8 Billion km from the Sun (~ 19 AU) 
- First visited and photographed by Voyager probe in 1986. (It has + 10 moons).
- Hydrogen and helium give atmosphere a distinctive blue color, not water.
- Interestingly, unlike other planets, **it rotates on its side**.
#### Neptune
- Second of the smaller gas giants
- Also determined to be blue (hydrogen content) in color by Voyager images in 1989, its atmosphere similar to Uranus
- Strangely, Neptune orbits the Sun in the opposite or **“retrograde” direction** when compared to other planets.
- Has approximately 15 known moons, to date.
#### Pluto – a “dwarf planet” or “Kuiper Belt” Object
- First seen by telescope in 1934
- A strange orbit, briefly inside that of Neptune
- Orbits the Sun every 247 years !
- Small rocky “dwarf” planet mixed with ice hardly bigger than Moon just visited & photographed by the New Horizons probe in 2015
- One moon – Charon, 1/3 its size, plus three other small satellites
#### Kuiper Belt Objects and “Oort Cloud”
- Kuiper belt objects were first predicted by a scientist by that name in the 1970s to be “proto-planets” source of material and life
- Other named ones include Eris and Sedna
- Oort Cloud lies further away at the edge of the Solar System ~ 1 light YEAR from the Sun
- Source of the comets we see occasionally as they approach the Sun

### Human efforts in exploring the space
#### China joins the exploration of the planets, in search of life
- China's Moon Rover Chang‘e 5 (+玉兔 2) – 2020
- China’s Mars Lander 祝融  2021
#### NASA’s Curiosity and Ingenuity “drone copter” on Mars
#### The deep space Voyager probes
- Voyager 1 and 2 launched in 1976 have passed the outer planets before 1990, famous for taking a photograph of Earth as a “*pale blue dot*”. 
- Now passing through the so-called “shock zone” into “inter-stellar” space, where electrons no longer orient toward the Sun.
- Voyager – at the very edge of interstellar space.
---
### The nearest stars – The Centauri systems
- For many years, the Alpha Centauri (visible in the night sky above the Southern Hemisphere) was considered our Sun’s closest neighbor.
- Recent observations with better equipment show a brown dwarf (dying star) Proxima Centauri and its twin to be closer at a distance of about 4 Light Years (recall explanation) AND possibly an Earth-like planet orbiting around it.
- In sum – the fastest spacecraft would need over 70,000 years to reach the Centauri star system.
---
### The latest contribution, … the James Webb Space Telescope
- 10 years late and billions of dollars over-budget, the much anticipated James Webb Telescope will take soon its place at the “L2” spot 1.5 million km from Earth.
- It will observe in the infra-red light spectrum further into space than ever before, inspect extra-solar systems for signs of life.
---
### The Planet Hunters
- Recent advances in detection, and other deduction methods have allowed astronomers to confirm the existence of over **4000 exoplanets**, or planets OUTSIDE our solar system orbiting other stars, or “suns”.
- While we now can detect and estimate exoplanet size, mass, orbiting distance and atmosphere content using mathematical models and spectrum analysis, we have **no images**. These are just **too far** away, and do not reflect enough light.
#### Exoplanet hunting techniques
##### Radical Velocity “wobble” measurement
- Effective for finding planets near closes stars.
##### Transit Method
- Theory: Starlight dims very slightly, or changes color, when a planet crosses in front of it – not unlike a mini-eclipse of our own Sun by planets in our solar system.
- Weakness = not all systems will be at favorable angles.
---
### And finally, … the search for “E.T.’s”(alien life)
- For forty (40) years, radio- astronomers and experts worldwide, in the **SETI – (Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence)** program have “listened” for electronic signals from potential advanced “alien” civilizations in the Universe. 
- Natural events called **quasars (rapidly spinning stars)** give off radio signals have often provided them with false hope.
- In 2016, **China** opened the world’s largest **radio telescope (FAST)** to join in this search.
#### Will we ever make “contact”?
- The1997movie “Contact” tells the fictional tale of a young astronomer who picks up radio signals from another galactic civilization, and briefly travels to their world.
---
### And, something else to think about – what is the cost-benefits analysis of space exploration?
- Space travel is expensive!
- But, Earth's resources are finite.
- What if we were able to find additional resources on the Moon or asteroids in space?
- Would it be “economical” to recover these?
