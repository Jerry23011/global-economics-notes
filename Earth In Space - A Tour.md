## Our Fragile Planet
### “Earth in Space”

#### How to observe
- The U.S. Space program (NASA) has space telescope **Hubble** has taken many amazing images of distant galaxies and other astronomical structures during the past 31 years.
#### The model of Space
- A simplified model for the scale of “Cosmological” organization would be like an **upside down triangle**
	- Universe (top)
	- Galaxy (middle)
	- Solar System (bottom)
#### Origins – The “Big Bang”
- The Hubble telescope has also detected light from the earliest Universe only now estimated to be 13.5 Billion years old – when the “**Big Bang**” formed it.
- We can say this since we know that light travels at 186, 000 miles (or 296 700 km) per second. At that speed, light from these points of light have taken 13.5 billion years to reach us at the speed of light.
#### Measuring distance units – Deep space to “near” space
- Measuring distance in space in terms of the speed of light is the most practical,
- Whereas, the distance to our next star is **4.2 light years**, (compare that with 13.5 Billion),     our own Moon is just **two** “**light seconds**” from Earth (ie. the time it takes to send an electronic signal).
- By contrast, it took **4.5** “**light hours**” for computer commands to reach, and electronic images to return from a recent probe to Pluto.
#### Galaxies –on edge, from above, and below.
- Earth and its solar system lie in a galaxy of stars we call “***The Milky Way***”.
- Our galaxy has a distinct spiral shape – in plan view, while other galaxies resemble “**discs**”, but each of them consists of millions (often hundreds of millions) of stars.
- Earth’s solar system lies on a spiral “arm” of stars about **2/3 of the way from our galaxy’s center.**
#### Planetary Nebula Gas clouds like the “Pillars of Eternity”
- Looking up the southwest summer night sky near the constellation Sagittarius on a summer’s night, we face the center of our Milky Way galaxy.
- Recent observations suggest that a dense “**black hole**” is found there.
- “**Black holes**” are in the fabric of space – swallowing light itself
#### Our Solar System – The Planets  
OVERVIEW
- Astronomers now agree that there are **eight (8)** planets in our solar system orbiting our star – the Sun.
- Pluto, considered a major planet for over 70 years, is now classified as a “dwarf planet", part of the outer “**Kuiper Belt**” objects.
#### Measuring distance within our Solar System
- The distance from Earth to the Sun, our star, is over 93 million miles (150 M. km),
- Astronomers conveniently describe this distance as **1 “Astronomical Unit” – 1 AU**.
- To compare, the dwarf planet Pluto just visited by a probe, is **39.48** A.U.’s, or multiples of Earth’s distance from the Sun.
