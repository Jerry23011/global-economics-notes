# “MLA” Citation Styles and Expectations
Using proper forms to identify academic sources when you research information for your assignments
## Citation styles – Introduction
- This assignment will mark your introduction to a Citation style known as **“MLA”**, (the other being APA) – approved by the American academic **“Modern Language Association”** relied upon by most Universities.
- In University, and beyond, academic “integrity” demands that researchers (including students) of all kinds “cite” or “acknowledge” the sources and phrasing of all ideas that are not their own.
### Two main types of citations
- **“In-text”** Citations (the kind of referencing you do in the middle of your paper, when you need to borrow an author’s ideas, or take a direct quote.), and secondly; at the end of a research paper, or biography – a **“Works Cited” or “End Citations”** page. There are some differences between these.
### Resources on MLA
- From the forwarded video that there are special formats that differ depending on whether you are citing information from a text book, a biography, a scientific journal, a video, or an internet website, among others, including PPT’s.
- Common approaches for the last two categories – (Internet citations and PPT’s) have only been developed in the past 30 years, as “on-line” information accessing technology has developed.

>[!Teacher's notes]
>I will also provide a few more links to a website and two short videos produced by **Columbia College** in Vancouver offering more guidance, one that is **easier** to follow than a similar printed guide produced by the **American Purdue University**.

>Here is the link for the “In-text” format of citing or referring to your sources within the text of the research paper itself. i.e. (Just list the author’s last name and source page).

#### And…
- Always remember that there must be **opening** (“) and **closing** (”) quotation symbols surrounding every direct quotation that is borrowed from another source.
- You may choose to paraphrase another author’s ideas (without quotation marks), but the source must still be acknowledged with an (In-text) Citation.

- This is the link for “Works Cited” or “End Citations/ References” section that appears at the end of any proper research paper written in an academic setting.

- And, … Remember – when you use “In-text” Citations, you still need to include the references you used in a list of “End Citations” or “Works Cited” on the last page of your paper.
