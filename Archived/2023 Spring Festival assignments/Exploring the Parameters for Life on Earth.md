## Seven factors that must be in place in order for life

**To sustain life, a planet should have both internal and external parameters ready.
The first four (4) parameters listed below are internal parameters, and the rest three (3) are external ones.**

### 1. The planet has to be in the habitable zone of a stellar system
Water, energy, and nutrients are necessary for life, so having the essential elements and substances is an important parameter for life. Assume we are talking about carbon-based life forms, the chemicals needed to make proteins and carbohydrates should be present. These elements can be obtained from food or water that are pre-existed on the planet. Other nutrients include fats, vitamins, and minerals are also necessary because they are involved in many important processes that occur within living organisms.
### 2. The planet's surrounding stars have to be “stable”
Without the atmosphere, water can’t be retained on the planet, and water is considered as a critical factor to sustain life. Also, an atmosphere is important to go through Greenhouse effect to keep the heat on the surface of the planet, and this process moderates the temperature on the planet. Additionally, If life on the planet needs to breathe, the atmosphere needs to contain that certain gas. Moreover, it protects the planet from some potential danger like slowing down the crushing asteroids from space or filtering the harmful rays from the stars. Finally, the atmosphere assists with cycles such as the water and the carbon cycle.

### 3. The planet should have necessary elements and substances for life.
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, atmosphere is important to life, but it is also important that the atmosphere don’t’ vanish. Gravity keeps the atmosphere from dissipating into space and as a human, it is difficult to imagine living on a planet without gravity. Without gravity, life would probably fly around in the sky and eventually disappear into space; it is gravity that is keeping us from going everywhere. In addition, gravity helps maintain the water cycle, without gravity, there will be no precipitation, and the rivers and the seas need gravity to keep flowing, so this ensures the source of life – water, is cycling.

### 4. Gravity
Resources, such as water, should be able to circulate on the planet so that all life forms can access it. On the Earth, this happens in a variety of ways, such as the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the gas exchange, etc. In addition, the self-rotation of the Earth causes the atmospheric circulation through the Coriolis Effect, an effect we touched on in Science 10. The Coriolis Effect influences the movement of air and water on the Earth's surface, which has a significant impact on weather patterns and ocean currents.
### 5. There should be an atmosphere
The planet’s surrounding star must be stable to provide the necessary light and heat for life, and the temperature on the planet will be moderate. In addition, a stable star means that it has a long life span so that it does not suddenly dim and something like the "Wondering Earth" would have to take place. The Sun is a good example of “a stable star” because it is a 4.5-billion-year-old yellow dwarf star that will continue to radiate light and heat from burning hydrogen and helium for another 5 billion years. Also, the Sun's activities, such as solar flares, are not too harmful because Earth’s magnetic field provides protection. Most importantly, the Sun provides the Earth with the light and heat necessary for plants, animals, and humans. Therefore, it is necessary for a planet to orbit around a sable star in order to provide a stable environment that can support life.
### 6. There should be a way for substance circulations
Even if the star is stable, the planet has no chance of supporting life if it is not in the habitable zone of a stellar system. The habitable zone is also known as the “Goldilocks zone”. It is defined as the area around a star where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of surrounding planets. The planet must be in the habitable zone of a stellar system that can sustain liquid water, which is essential for life. Also, being in the habitable zone will keep the temperature on the planet moderate because the energy and heat radiated from the star will be moderate for the planet. The Goldilocks Zone will be further explained later in question II of this document.
### 7. Stability, or “Umbrellas” to protect the planet.
Sometimes “Umbrellas” are necessary to protect the planet. Take Earth as an instance, Jupiter is an umbrella to the Earth, for it attracted numerous asteroids or meteorites entering the solar system from hitting Earth. This applies the same way to other planets as well. Also, the magnetic field of the is an umbrella to prevent the planet from the danger of solar flares and other radiations that are harmful to lives on the planet. In addition, the atmosphere mentioned above can also provide protection to the planet from dangers from outer space.

## The “Goldilocks Zone”

The Goldilocks zone, or the habitable zone, is defined as the area around a star where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of surrounding planets.

If the planet is too far from the star, like Pluto, the heat energy would be too low to maintain the temperature for liquid water to exist; if the planet is too close to the star, like Mercury, the water would form a vapor atmosphere and quickly boil off. The distance the Earth orbits the Sun is just right for water to remain liquid. Earth is in the "Goldilocks zone" of the solar system. This is important for life on Earth because research shows that life on Earth began with water, and water is a necessary ingredient for life.

It is helpful in the search for extraterrestrial life because when man has the technology to freely travel in space in search of life, it is most likely that life exists on planets located in the Goldilocks Zone of a star system. In this way, humans can effectively and efficiently search for extraterrestrial life in an unfamiliar system. An example of a potentially life-bearing planet could be the Earth-sized planet Kepler-186f, where scientists hope to find water.

As for our own circumstances, the Sun, which has supported life on Earth for nearly four billion years, is classified as a "G-type" yellow star; however, G-type yellow stars are shorter-lived and less common in our galaxy, so it is rare to find another planet like Earth in space.

## Earth’s orbital tilt

About 10,000-100,000 years ago, the gravitational pull of other celestial bodies caused the Earth's orbit to tilt. This change makes the temperature moderate enough for life.

Currently, the Earth's orbital tilt angle is about 23.4 degrees. Since the angle doesn't change as the Earth orbits the Sun, the two hemispheres, North and South, receive different amounts of heat energy from the Sun at any given time. As the Earth orbits the Sun, they will alternately receive more solar radiation, and each hemisphere will receive more during its summer due to the more direct angle of sunlight.

Because the two hemispheres alternate in receiving more heat energy from the Sun during the period when the Earth rotates around the Sun, the two hemispheres receive almost the same amount of energy throughout the year. Because of this, the temperature on Earth is moderated by the changing "seasons" and this prevents one hemisphere from getting too much heat while the other doesn't. Therefore, the orbital tilt balances the temperature on Earth. If the Earth didn't tilt, the equatorial region would be too hot because it receives direct radiation, while the polar regions would be too cold because they receive little radiation. In conclusion, orbital tilt creates more habitable areas on Earth.

## The Greenhouse Effect

Typically, a "greenhouse" is used to grow plants. It is made of glass or clear plastic to let in lots of sunlight and to moderate the temperature inside the greenhouse.

The Greenhouse effect refers to the process that occurs when gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, and this effect is one of the things that makes the Earth a comfortable place to live.

In the Greenhouse effect, the atmosphere is the “glass” of the greenhouse. In the atmosphere, certain gases, which are known as greenhouse gases, accumulate in the Earth’s atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3), and fluorinated gases. These gases allow the sun's light to shine on the Earth's surface and then trap these gases in the Earth's atmosphere to keep the temperature moderate for life.

- The atmosphere allows about half of the Sun's heat energy (50%) to reach Earth's surface.
- About a third of the Sun's energy (30%) is reflected into space.
- The rest of the Sun's energy (20%) is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

According to researches, the average temperature of Earth would drop from 14˚C (57˚F) to as low as –18˚C (–0.4˚F), without the greenhouse effect.
## Earth’s Moon

When we look at space from Earth, the Moon is probably the largest and brightest object in the sky. It gives us both light and makes the Earth a more habitable planet. The Moon moderates the Earth's wobble on its axis, resulting in a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has persisted for thousands of years.

The Moon has a diameter of about 3,500 km, and its average distance from the Earth is 384,400 km, or about 30 times the Earth's diameter. The leading theory of the Moon's origin is that a Mars-sized body collided with the Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, and debris from both the Earth and the impacting object accumulated to form the Moon. The molten state of the Moon crystallized, and with less dense rocks floating up to form the crust, the Moon eventually became solid.

The "Lunar Calendar" was created based on the steady change of the Moon between new and full. One of the most obvious influences of this rhythm is reflected in the Earth's tides. The gravitational pull of the Moon causes a bulge of water to form on the nearest side of the Earth and another bulge on the opposite side, which is the farthest away. As the Moon orbits the Earth, the part of the Earth affected by the Moon's pull shifts, creating a high tide every 12 hours at a particular point on the Earth. Tides are important because they maintain the marine ecosystem. For example, some marine animals use tides for their reproductive activities by changing places in the water.

The Moon also dampens the amount the Earth wobbles on its axis, helping to keep our climate more stable. The wobble in our planet's tilt affects how the sun's energy is distributed across the Earth and can influence the frosty advance or retreat of ice ages. Without the moon, scientists estimate that our planet's tilt could have varied by as much as 85 degrees, causing wild swings in climate.

The Moon also prevents some potential asteroids, meteoroids, and comets from hitting the Earth. This can be seen from the uneven moon surface.
