## Criteria for habitability
> The standard definition for a habitable planet is one that can sustain life for a significant period of time. — NASA
### 1. It has to be a comfortable distance away from a star 

### 2. The surrounding stars have to be “stable”

### 3. The planet should be far away from a second star

### 4. It should not have a very low or very high mass

### 5. It must rotate on its axis and revolve.

### 6. It should have a molten core

### 7. It should hold an atmosphere

### 8. It should contain liquid water and other compounds that are required for life

### 9. “Umbrellas” such as another celestial body that attracts asteroids, or having a magnetic field like that of the Earth.
